Hi Grader
  My hash table results are different than lab guides', I don't know if mine is correct,
But I feel like they are decent and the output in lab guide is wrong somehow. Maybe I was
wrong, and I don't quite understand how third question for lab report mean, I just wrote down
something that I think is correct.

Your regards
Haonan
